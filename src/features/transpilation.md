# A language designed for code translation

ZenCode is designed to be translated to many different languages on different targets. This major goal has influenced many decisions in the language and its rules - getting the same code to work in different programming languages is not trivial.

With code transpilation, code is written once and then compiled to different languages - assuming that the code was written without using platform-specific dependencies.
